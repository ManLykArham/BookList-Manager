BookList Manager

BookList Manager is a C# application that implements a linked list to manage a collection of books. The application supports adding, removing, displaying, and sorting books based on ISBN, author, and title. This project highlights my proficiency in data structures, generic programming, and object-oriented design, with a focus on linked list operations and Windows Forms UI development.
