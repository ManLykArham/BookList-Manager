# 📚 BookList Manager

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

**BookList Manager** is a C# application that leverages the **linked list** data structure to manage a collection of books. Users can easily **add**, **remove**, **display**, and **sort** books based on ISBN, author, and title, all through a user-friendly interface built with **Windows Forms**. 💻

In this project, I enhanced my understanding of **linked list operations** and implemented features that make managing collections more efficient. I also strengthened my skills in **generic programming** and **object-oriented design**, ensuring the code is both scalable and maintainable. Developing a real-time, responsive UI gave me hands-on experience in creating a smooth, interactive user interface. 🎯
