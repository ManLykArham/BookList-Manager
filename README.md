# BookList Manager

BookList Manager is a C# application that implements a linked list to manage a collection of books. The application supports adding, removing, displaying, and sorting books based on ISBN, author, and title. This project highlights my proficiency in data structures, generic programming, and object-oriented design, with a focus on linked list operations and Windows Forms UI development.

## Instructions:

### Add Books:

Input the bookâ€™s title, author, and ISBN to add it to the linked list.

### Display Books:

View all the books in the linked list.

### Remove Books:

Input the book's ISBN to remove it from the list.

### Sort Books:

Sort the linked list of books based on ISBN.

### Example:

Add books: "Book A" (ISBN: 123), "Book B" (ISBN: 456).
Sort the books by ISBN.

### Expected output:

"Book A", "Book B" (sorted by ISBN).
